      <p className="intro-home-7">If you’ve been drinking the mass marketed beer, wine or liquor produced by major companies for a long time, you should try out craft alcoholic beverages. Craft alcoholic beverage are made by small local and independent brewers, Winemakers, and Distillers who work hard to create rich, unique, flavours that the major companies hardly ever achieve in their large breweries, wineries and distilleries. They tell us what’s new and available, we tell you.</p>
